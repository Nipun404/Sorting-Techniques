# Quick Sort
Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where an array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).

While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and elements greater than pivot are on the right side of the pivot.
The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.
At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally, elements are combined to form a sorted array.




## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.

Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.
We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. In the same way, other unsorted cards are taken and put in their right place.


## Shell Sort

Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.

The interval between the elements is reduced based on the sequence used.
